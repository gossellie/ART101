    <p>Kyle Rayner. Kyle Rayner is a high-ranking member of the Green Lantern Corps from Earth. After the rest of the
      Corps was destroyed, he alone was selected to bear the last power ring and carry on the title. Although he acted
      alone for many years, when the Corps was reformed, his skill level gave him a position as an Honor Guard, only
      behind Salakk and the Guardians in the chain of command of the Corps.</p>
